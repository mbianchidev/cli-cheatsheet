# cli-cheatsheet
A cheatsheet for various CLIs, I do not take any responsibility for the content of the files, use at your own risk.
I wrote these files for my own use, but I decided to share them in case someone else finds them useful.
Some of the files are incomplete and most of them contain italian comments, I will translate them in the future.
